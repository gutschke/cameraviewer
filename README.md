Minimal installable PWA that detects an attached video capture device or camera and displays it in a fullsize window. While every hardware and browser combination behaves a little differently, this code attempts to set the capture device to the maximum resolution. This allows you to use a small portable capture device instead of lugging around a bulky external LCD monitor. Intended use cases are things like setting up headless servers or configuring embedded devices such as a Raspberry Pi.
